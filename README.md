## Technical challenges

The project has been created entirely in React.
The technical difficulties that I have had to face have been calling to the spotaroom backend
services, as well as how to make a responsive design that fits the needs of both the mobile and desktop screen


## Repo instructions

This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

To make it work, you first have to:

- Install create-react-app by typing: npm install -g create-react-app Then, clone the repo & run npm install to install the dependencies.

- In the project directory, you can type npm start to run the app in the development mode.

- Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

In the terminal, type ctrl/cmd + c to stop it from running.
